# Smart-Home-System

The objective of this project, which this code was written for, was to design a physical model of a simple smart home. The model needed to include computational logics to automatically control lights and other devices based on information from sensors. The code runs the system of the smart home (More details of the overall project in the following link https://rraffa.myportfolio.com/smart-home-system)
